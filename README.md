# Sorting Visualizer

![demo](./public/demo.png)

### This single page website shows a simple visualization of a handful of common sortinng algorithms.

Please see the live version of this app at [] -----.

I have been fascinated by the algorithms since I learned, and I wanted to build a visualization of how each of algorithms works.
As I was studying React, I thought it would be a great opportunity to practice React while implementing the sorting visualizer.
There were many obstacles while building this, mainly learning hooks and extracting animations while sorting.

This application is built using React, React-Spring and Semantic-UI
